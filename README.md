Please install Prettier for styling and spend 1 minute going through the simple folder structure.

Styling

There is some global styling under the /src/styles/ path. If you do not use SCSS as much look at the SCSS folder connected to the Instructions component and view the nesting.

Currently we are using certain global SCSS variables. More specifically you can find them in the /src/styles/colors. Please use these variables when working with colors. For example for color #1E2434 in the design use color: $dark-blue and you will get the color below.

Typescript

If this is the first time using TypeScript there are some sample implementations of TypeScript in the ExampleCard.tsx component.

Please keep these instructions for now and insert the relevant components below, we are going to delete these instructions soon

PS: These instructions could have been written in a comment, but they are here to ensure that they are read
